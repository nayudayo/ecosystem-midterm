      title: "Population Size",
      impact: "can affect potential for adaptation because it affects the amount of genetic variation present in the population."
    },
    {
      title: "Population Density",
      effects: "can have effects on interactions within a population such as competition for food and the ability of individuals to find a mate. Smaller organisms tend to be more densely distributed than larger organisms."

      title: "Sampling techniques for determining population size and density",
      description: "The most accurate way to determine population size is to simply count all of the individuals within the habitat. However, this method is often not logistically or economically feasible, especially when studying large habitats. Thus, scientists usually study populations by sampling a representative portion of each habitat and using this data to make inferences about the habitat as a whole."
    },
    {
      title: "Quadrat",
      definition: "Immobile organisms such as plants, or for very small and slow-moving organisms",
      method: "A quadrat is a way of marking off square areas within a habitat, either by staking out an area with sticks and string, or by the use of a wood, plastic, or metal square placed on the ground. After setting the quadrants, researchers then count the number of individuals that lie within their boundaries. Multiple quadrat samples are performed throughout the habitat at several random locations. All of this data can then be used to estimate the population size and population density within the entire habitat."

    {
      title: "Mark and Recapture",
      definition: "For mobile organisms",
      method: "This method involves marking a sample of captured animals in some way (such as tags, bands, paint, or other body markings), and then releasing them back into the environment to allow them to mix with the rest of the population; later, a new sample is collected, including some individuals that are marked (recaptures) and some individuals that are unmarked. Using the ratio of marked and unmarked individuals, scientists determine how many individuals are in the sample. From this, calculations are used to estimate the total population size."

        "For rare organisms, such as top predators",
        "Camera traps are typically equipped with a motion sensor that is automatically triggered by movement in its vicinity.",
        "The great advantage of camera traps is that they can record very accurate data without disturbing the photographed animal.",
        "They minimally disturb wildlife and can replace the use of more invasive survey and monitoring techniques such as live trap and release."

      title: "Habitat Specialists",
      definition: "Only occur in specific places where a certain type of ecosystem occurs.",

        "Total geographic area occupied by a species.",
        "Bald Eagles can be found breeding in almost every state of the USA and most provinces of Canada.",
        "Its geographic range encompasses almost all of North America north of Mexico.",
        "In contrast, Golden Eagles breed almost exclusively in western Canada, the western United States, and Mexico.",

        "This results in the population distribution and geographic range being essentially the same.",
        "A species' current geographic range is often very different from its historical range.",
        "Factors such as habitat loss, hunting, and climate change can all reduce the distribution of populations and the species' overall geographic range.",
        "For example, lions previously ranged broadly over Africa, Western Asia, the Middle East, and India."
