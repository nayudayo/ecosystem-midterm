        definition: "A food chain refers to the order of events in an ecosystem, where one living organism eats another organism, and later that organism is consumed by another larger organism. The flow of nutrients and energy from one organism to another at different trophic levels forms a food chain.",
        historicalNote: {
            fact: "Charles Elton introduced the modern concept of the food chains in his 1927 book Animal Ecology. Also, he introduced the idea of food web, which he called food cycle."
